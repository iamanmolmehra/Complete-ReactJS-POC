The best way for code splitting into the app is through the dynamic import() syntax. 
The React.lazy function allows us to render a dynamic import as a regular component.      

If the module which contains the ExampleComponent is not yet loaded by the function 
component(MyComponent), then we need to show some fallback content while we are waiting 
for it to load.
